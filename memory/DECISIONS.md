# DECISIONS — append-only ledger

Rules: only user-confirmed decisions are recorded. Nothing is edited or deleted. A changed decision gets a **new** entry that `supersedes D-xxx`, and the old entry receives exactly one added line: `→ superseded by D-yyy (date)`. Sequential ids, never reused. (Full protocol: ballast decision-ledger skill.)

## D-001 · Adopt the ballast memory structure — 2026-08-22 (user, project setup)

This project uses `memory/` as its durable brain: decisions in this ledger, unresolved items in OPEN-QUESTIONS, per-session notes in SESSION-LOG. Standing decisions are followed without relitigating; changes go through the supersede protocol.

## D-002 · Use a three-tier architecture — 2026-08-22 (user, repository architecture analysis)

The target architecture will use a three-tier structure. The concrete WEB, WAS, data, availability, and deployment choices remain open until the repository-grounded options are compared.
